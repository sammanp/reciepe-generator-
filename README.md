🍽️ Recipe Generator
A simple and interactive recipe generator built with Python! This project uses natural language processing techniques and a trained model to generate creative and coherent cooking recipes.

📖 Project Description
The Recipe Generator leverages machine learning to produce text-based recipes, one word at a time. 
It's designed to mimic human-like recipe writing by training a model on a dataset of cooking instructions. This can be useful for inspiration in the kitchen or just as a fun AI experiment!
✨ Features
Trained on real-world recipe text data
Generates recipes from scratch based on user input or random seed text
Uses a word-level tokenizer and a sequential neural network model (LSTM)
Includes interactive notebook cells for training and testing the model

🧠 Technologies Used
Python
Keras (TensorFlow backend)
NumPy
Pandas
NLTK

Recipe Start:
Add the onion and garlic to a large skillet over medium heat.
Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, basil, and salt.
Simmer for 20 minutes and serve over pasta.
📌 Notes
This is a basic model and may generate grammatically incorrect or incoherent sentences occasionally.
Recipe generation can be improved with more data and a deeper model.
